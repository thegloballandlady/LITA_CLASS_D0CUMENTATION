# LITA_CLASS_D0CUMENTATION
This is my first git on data analysis

### BECOMING A DATA ANALYST: MY IMPRESSIVE STORY
---
Joining LITA is truly a miracle since i decided to transition into the tech field, I had always been sceptical about certain things and understanding code was one of them. 
When life gives you oranges, make as many orange smoothies and pies you want from it and even sell some to make extra cash, funny as it may appear, i believe we are one way or the other making smoothies from all that life throws at us and we are becoming better and brighter with each passing day.
Being a big believer of the Word of God which says that the path of just shines brighter and brighter until the perfect day.


### HOW DO I WANT TO ACHIEVE THIS 
---
Working diligently is said to make one sit before kings and not mean me, i believee that's my goal to give myself to continious learning, be determined, put in the extra work, overcome my fears and become better and brighter. 
I know it might look childish to make a wish but i wish to be an outstanding data analyst, one with a difference not just in words but deeds. To stand out and to never tell myseelf it isn't possible or it isn't meant to be.
I know all things are possible to them that believe as well as work smart.
